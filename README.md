# Project Title

## Description

This is a project with a few lab work for university. It's built with TypeScript and managed with npm and Yarn.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Yarn

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`

### Executing program

- To run the tests, use the following command: `yarn test`
- To run the tests for the first lab, use the following command: `yarn test:first-lab`
- To run the tests for the second lab, use the following command: `yarn test:second-lab`

## First Lab

The first lab includes implementations of various tasks. The files for the first lab are located in the `1-lab` directory:

- `firstPoint.ts`: Implementation of the first task.
- `secondPoint.ts`: Implementation of the second task.
- `thirdPoint.ts`: Implementation of the third task.

### Running the First Lab

To run the tasks for the first lab, use the following commands:

```bash
yarn test:first-lab
```

### Second Lab

The second lab includes implementations of various sorting algorithms. The files for the second lab are located in the `2-lab` directory:

- `countingSort.ts`: Implementation of the counting sort algorithm.
- `quickSort.ts`: Implementation of the quick sort algorithm.
- `selectionSort.ts`: Implementation of the selection sort algorithm.
- `standardSort.ts`: Implementation of the standard sort algorithm.

### Running Tests for the Second Lab

To run the tests for the second lab, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test:second-lab
```

## Fourth Lab

The fourth lab includes an implementation of a linked list. The files for the fourth lab are located in the `4-lab` directory:

- `linkedList.ts`: Contains the `LinkedList` and `ListNode` classes. The `LinkedList` class includes methods for manipulating the linked list, such as `append()` for adding nodes to the list and `printList()` for printing the values of nodes in the list.

### Running Tests for the Fourth Lab

To run the tests for the fourth lab, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test:fourth-lab
```
